Don’t forget that those students who say that they have never played video games or do not at all like video games are asked to skip over some of these questions.

To do this, use the questions in the last part of the survey, and make comparisons between male and female students, those who work for pay and this who don’t , those who own a computer and those who don’t. Graphical display and cross-tabulations are particularly helpful in making these kinds of comparisons.
